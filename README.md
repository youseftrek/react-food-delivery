# 🍕 Food Delivery App

This project is a modern food delivery application that allows users to order pizzas from a menu. It aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for ordering food without requiring user accounts or logins.

## ✨ Features

- **🍽️ Simple Ordering:** Users can order one or more pizzas from a menu.
- **🔓 No Accounts or Logins:** Users simply input their names before using the app.
- **📦 Dynamic Menu:** The pizza menu is loaded from an API and can change dynamically.
- **🛒 Cart Functionality:** Users can add multiple pizzas to a cart before placing an order.
- **📝 Easy Ordering Process:** Ordering only requires the user's name, phone number, and address.
- **🚀 Priority Orders:** Users can mark their order as "priority" for an additional 20% of the cart price.
- **📦 Order Submission:** Orders are made by sending a POST request with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API.
- **💵 On-Delivery Payments:** Payments are made on delivery, so no payment processing is necessary in the app.
- **🔍 Order Tracking:** Each order gets a unique ID that is displayed for users to look up their order later.
